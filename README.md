## How I work: 
I personnally like to discover new ways of coding. What fascinates me is that you can give the same task to 100 different people, each one of them will find and give you a different code. I like to build my way to the solution by gathering pieces and using them thoughtfully.
# What I would like to achieve
A goal I would like to attain is to get a more realistic experience in a professional environment, where I will be able to use the knowledge collected at James Madison University to put it into concrete result.
